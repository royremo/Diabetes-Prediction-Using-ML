# Diabetes-Prediction-Using-ML
This project aims to predict the likelihood of an individual developing diabetes using machine learning techniques. It utilizes a dataset containing various health-related features to train predictive models.
We explored several machine learning algorithms including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, Decision Tree, and XGBoost classifier for predicting diabetes risk. Among these, SVM emerged as the best-performing model, achieving an accuracy score of 0.77 on the test dataset.
Our evaluation results indicate that SVM outperforms other models with an accuracy of 0.77 on the test dataset. This suggests that SVM is well-suited for predicting diabetes risk based on the given features.
